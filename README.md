# Data_filter-using-PYTHON-PANDAS
this python scripts uses panda libraries to filter mix data and saves filtered data into saparate excel file. 

here in the CSV file there is mix data of STOCKS futures and its options tick by tick. 

this one CSV file is only for example purpose..i separated 12+ millions line of data using this code. feel free to use it...
i use this code to separate futures data from options data because i only wanted futures data of specific stock.

this code will save filtered data into new excel file with proper date and time arrangement.
